# Expander-family-and-Cayley-groups
Notes for MATH 3999 directed study (capstone course for my math major at HKU), under the topic of Expander family and Cayley Graphs. <br/>
One line summary: how to construct arbitrarily large efficient (communication) networks using groups. <br/>
Quick answer: none of elementary groups work (including abelian, Dihedral, and finitely solvable groups). <br/>
<br/>
Notes are based on book Expander Families and Cayley Graphs (2011). They are prepared to present these book chapters for my supervisor. I filled in many gaps in proofs and made them more comprehensible. <br/>
First two chapters are typed with markdown, later chapters with latex. Latex are much better suited for mathmatical texts. <br/>
I will upload later chapters once the presentation is done. <br/>
