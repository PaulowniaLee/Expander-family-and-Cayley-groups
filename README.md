# Expander-family-and-Cayley-groups
- Notes for MATH 3999 directed study (capstone course for my math major at HKU), under the topic of Expander family and Cayley Graphs. Plan of the course is that student first study the topic under minimal guidance of the supervisor, then present the topic and answering challenged arised by the supervisor and other classmates.
- One line summary: how to construct arbitrarily large efficient (communication) networks using groups. 
- Quick answer: none of elementary groups work (including abelian, Dihedral, and finitely solvable groups). Feasible constructions involve wreath products or the theory of group representation.
- Notes are based on book *Expander Families and Cayley Graphs* (2011). They are prepared for my presentation. I filled in many gaps in proofs and made them more comprehensible. 
- First two chapters are typed with markdown, later chapters with latex. I will upload later chapters once the presentation is done. When the whole course is done, I will combine latest notes for all chapters into one single pdf file.
